Exports various MSTW custom post types to CSV format files.

== Description ==

The MSTW CSV Exporter plugin exports custom post types from the MSTW Game Schedules, MSTW Game Locations, and MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugins to CSV format files for import into the MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugin, and the MSTW Team Roster (3.2.1) plugin for import into the MTW Team Rosters (4.0 and beyond) plugin. This data export/import is necessary to allow the migration of plugin data across sites.

Version 1.2 adds the ability to export the MSTW Team Rosters (v 3.2.1) data structures - Players and Teams - for import to MSTW Team Rosters 4.0. It allows player photos to be moved from site to site automagically in the import/export process, or not if you are upgrading Team Rosters on a site. See [the Team Rosters CSV Import man page](http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/tr-loading-csv-files/)</a> for more information.
