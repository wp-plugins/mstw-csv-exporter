Exports various MSTW custom post types to CSV format files.

== Description ==

The MSTW CSV Exporter plugin exports custom post types from the MSTW Game Schedules, MSTW Game Locations, and MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugins to CSV format files for import into the MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugin. This allows the migration of plugin data across sites.

Version 1.0 supported migration of the MSTW Game Locations and MSTW Game Schedules plugins to the new MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugin. The old plugins have been integrated into the new plugin, which changed the data structures (in the custom post types) to support more robust data migration across sites running the Schedules & Scoreboards plugin.

Version 1.1 added the ability to export the new MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugin data tables - Games, Teams, Schedules, Sports, and Venues - AND the associated Venue Group and Scoreboard taxonomies, for import to another site.
