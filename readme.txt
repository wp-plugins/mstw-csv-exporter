Exports MSTW custom data types to CSV format files for backup, upgrade, and migration across installs.

== Description ==

The MSTW CSV Exporter plugin exports all data types from the MSTW Game Schedules, MSTW Game Locations, and MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugins to CSV format files for import into the MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards v4.0 plugin, and the MSTW Team Roster (v3.2.1) plugin for import into the MSTW Team Rosters (v4.0) plugin. This data export/import is necessary to allow the migration of plugin data across sites. The plugin also exports MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards v4.0 and MSTW Team Rosters v4.0 data.

Version 1.2 adds the ability to export the MSTW Team Rosters (v3.2.1) data structures - Players and Teams - for import to MSTW Team Rosters v4.0. It allows player photos to be moved from site to site automagically in the import/export process (or not if you are upgrading Team Rosters on one site). See [the Team Rosters CSV Import man page](http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/tr-loading-csv-files/)</a> for more information.
